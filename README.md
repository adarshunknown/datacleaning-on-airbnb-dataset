# 🏡 Airbnb Data Cleaning Project

This project involves the cleaning and preprocessing of publicly available Airbnb listing data to make it ready for analysis and visualization. The dataset provides a wide range of features such as location, host details, room types, pricing, availability, and more.

## 📂 Project Structure

* `Airbnb_Open_Data.csv`: Original raw dataset from Airbnb.
* `Data cleaning 1.csv`: Cleaned version of the dataset after preprocessing steps.
* `Data Cleaning on airbnb dataset.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the step-by-step data cleaning process with code and commentary.

## 🧼 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to prepare Airbnb data for analysis by:

* Identifying and handling missing values
* Removing duplicate entries
* Standardizing data formats (e.g., date, price)
* Filtering out invalid or inconsistent records
* Renaming and restructuring columns for clarity
* Converting data types for efficiency

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used
